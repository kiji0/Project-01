more than 8 knots +2

a major choice: killing any of the stripfolk ( see lines 168 and 206) prevents them from appearing in the club in the good ending, killing them also prevents the good ending from occuring as you wont gain enough swag points. +7.5

a loop: a day night cycle (see 298) + 7.5

player picks up a coupon that allows them to go out to eat with a mischevious employee, (see lines 219, 120) +1

   player has a statistic attributed to strength that allows them to feast on certain stripfolk if stong enough. (see 181, 264) +1
   
two passages are kept track of (see line 31, 39 and 77, 87) +1

- Create an interactive fiction story with at least 8 knots. Reminder: a knot starts with === a_knot ===
    - Create at least one major choice that the player can make. A major choice is something that changes the ending of the story.
    - Include at least one loop ( A knot that references itself )

   
    To get a full 20 points, expand upon the game in the following ways
    [+2] Include more than eight knots
    [+1] Allow the player to pick up items and change the state of the game if certain items are in the inventory. Acknowledge if a player does or does not have a certain item
    [+1] Give the player statistics, and allow them to upgrade once or twice. Gate certain options based on statistics (high or low. Maybe a weak person can only do things a strong person can't, and vice versa)
    [+1] Keep track of visited passages and only display the description when visiting for the first time (or requested)
